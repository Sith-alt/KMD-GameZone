    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
Home Sweet Home is a first-person horror game inspired by Thai mythology and folklore. The story follows Tim, a man searching for his missing wife after a mysterious tragedy disrupts his life. As he explores eerie environments, Tim finds himself trapped in a haunted world filled with terrifying spirits. The game features atmospheric storytelling, with clues hidden throughout abandoned buildings and blood-stained halls.

Stealth and puzzle-solving are key mechanics, as players must avoid supernatural threats rather than confront them. The main antagonist, a ghostly schoolgirl, stalks Tim relentlessly, creating intense moments of suspense. *Home Sweet Home* builds fear through its sound design, lighting, and cultural symbolism rather than jump scares alone. The narrative unfolds slowly, revealing deep emotional trauma and dark secrets tied to Thai beliefs about death and the afterlife.

Players must stay alert, use hiding spots, and solve puzzles to survive. With its unique cultural elements and chilling presentation, *Home Sweet Home* delivers a memorable psychological horror experience.</p>
